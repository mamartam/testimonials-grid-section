# Testimonials grid section
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 — semantic markup for structured and accessible content
- CSS3 — custom styling and layout implementation
- CSS Grid — main layout system for building a responsive grid-based design
- Flexbox — used for aligning elements внутри компонентів (user info section)
- Responsive Web Design — mobile-first approach with multiple breakpoints
- Google Fonts — Barlow Semi Condensed font family
- CSS Media Queries — adapting layout for tablet and desktop screens
- CSS Positioning ('relative' / 'absolute') — for decorative background elements
- Box Model & Reset styles — consistent spacing and sizing across browsers

ℹ️ This project was built without any JavaScript to focus on mastering layout techniques and responsive design using modern CSS.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to build complex responsive layouts using `CSS Grid` with multiple breakpoints
- How to translate a design layout into a grid structure by planning columns and rows
- How to combine `CSS Grid and Flexbox` effectively (Grid for layout, Flexbox for internal alignment)
- How to use grid-column and grid-row to precisely control element placement
- How to manage stacking context with position and z-index
- How to handle decorative elements using `position: absolute` without affecting content flow
- The importance of a `mobile-first approach` when building responsive interfaces
- How small details like spacing, typography, and line-height improve overall UI quality
- How to structure reusable and readable `HTML/CSS` code

## 🚀 How Can It Be Improved?
- Simplify the grid layout by reducing the number of explicitly defined rows and relying more on the natural flow of CSS Grid
- Refactor repeated styles into reusable utility or component classes to improve maintainability
- Improve accessibility by enhancing color contrast and adding focus states for interactive elements
- Add support for users who prefer reduced motion using prefers-reduced-motion
- Optimize images and consider using modern formats for better performance
- Add light animations or transitions to enhance user experience without overwhelming the interface
